    Title: Header for camwire_1394.c

    Description:
    This module is about using a single named camera through its
    handle. The handle should be all a user need know about for complete
    access to all camera functions.  Finding cameras and assigning
    handles to them is done in the Camwire bus module.

   camwire_create_from_struct().  Camwire uses this struct internally
   for shadowing current settings but these are not available to the
   user via this type.  Use the individual access functions instead.

   Each member corresponds to the arguments of the camwire_get/set_...()
   functions:

   num_frame_buffers:	The number of frames to store, not counting any
                        buffers internal to the camera.  Minimum 2,
                        maximum according to how much free memory (RAM)
			you have.

   gain:		Relative pixel gain which sets the slope of the
			response, between 0.0 and 1.0.

   brightness:		Relative image brightness which sets the pixel
			black level, between -1.0 and +1.0.

   blue_gain, red_gain:	Relative blue (U-value) and red (V-value) white
 			balance levels for colour cameras, each between
 			0.0 and 1.0.

   left, top:		Top left-hand corner of region-of-interest in
                        sensor pixel coordinates.  The top left-hand
			corner pixel of the sensor is at (0,0), and the
			bottom right-hand corner pixel is at
			(sensorwidth-1, sensorheight-1).  Only
			applicable to scalable image sizes.

  width, height:	Width (X dimension) and height (Y dimension) in
                        pixels of the region-of-interest (scalable
			sizes) or the whole image (fixed sizes).

  coding:               One of the Camwire_pixel enumeration (see
                        above).

  frame_rate:		The rate at which the camera transmits frames to
                        the computer, in frames per second.  The actual
			frame rate may be determined by an external
			trigger frequency or image processing speed.

  shutter:		The integration time, in seconds.

  external_trigger:	Flag set to non-zero to trigger frame
                        acquisition on a hardware trigger signal (if
			available), otherwise the camera sends frames at
			the rate programmed with frame_rate above.

  trigger_polarity:	Flag set to non-zero for triggering on a rising
                        edge of the extenal trigger signal, otherwise it
			triggers on the falling edge.  Ignored if
			external triggering is not used.

  single_shot:		Flag set to non-zero to put camera in
                        single-shot mode (in which only one frame is
			transmitted), otherwise frame transmission is
			continuous when the camera is running.

  running:		Flag set to non-zero to start frame transmission
                        (possibly pending an external trigger if used),
			otherwise the camera is stopped and does not
			transmit frames to the computer.

  shadow:		Flag set to non-zero to cause, wherever
			possible, camera settings to be read from this
			struct, otherwise they are read directly from
			the camera hardware (which takes longer and may
			cause congestion of the asynchronous bandwidth).

   does not exist, an error message is printed which includes a

   configuration file (and edited as needed).  The filename must be
   identical to one of the camera's ID strings (as may be obtained from
   camwire_get_identifier()) appended by an extension of ".conf".  The
   function checks for existing filenames containing the unique chip
   string, or the model name string, or the vendor name string, in this
   order.  It first looks for the three filenames in the current working
   directory and after that in a directory given by the CAMWIRE_CONF

   time it is read by the current camera with handle c_handle.  There
   should be no need to call this function from a user program for

   Setting state shadowing may result in faster camera responses and may
   increase robustness because the camera firmware is not interrupted by
   unnecessary status requests.  State shadowing may however be slightly
   risky because bugs in Camwire or in the camera firmware could cause
   the shadow state to differ from the actual state.  The state shadow
   flag of a created camera can be modified at any time because the

   *num_flashed.  *num_flushed will be less than num_to_flush if there
   were fewer buffered frames available to flush than requested.
   *num_flushed will never be more than num_to_flush.  It is safe to
   make num_to_flush a larger number than the total number of buffered
   frames.  If buffer_lag is not the null pointer, the number of bus
   frame buffers by which we are behind after flushing is returned in
   *buffer_lag.  This is the same number as can be obtained from
   camwire_get_framebuffer_lag().  *buffer_lag is only valid if
   num_to_flush was 1 or more.  The historically older frames are
   flushed first.  Frames currently being transmitted by the camera are
   not affected.  Any frames accessed by camwire_point_next_frame() or
   camwire_point_next_frame_poll() should first be released with
   camwire_unpoint_frame() before flushing.  If you want to be sure of
   completely emptying all bus frame buffers, you should stop the
   camera, wait for more than one frame transmission period and then
   flush.  Returns CAMWIRE_SUCCESS on success or CAMWIRE_FAILURE on
   failure. */

   changes depending on the single-shot and trigger source settings.
   The frame rate determines how long frame transmission from camera to
   computer takes and how much bus bandwidth is used.  With internal
   trigger, non-single-shot (continuous), it is indeed the number of
   frames per second.  With external trigger, non-single-shot, it should
